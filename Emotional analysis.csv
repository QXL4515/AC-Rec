2461,"undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . ",0
2462,how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . ,0
2463,the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . ,0
2464,"the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . ",0
2465,"the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . ",0

2471,"for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . ",0
2472,un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image . ,0
2473,"when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . ",0
2474,what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . ,0
2475,"while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . ",0
2476,"yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? ",0
2477,"preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . ",0
2478,calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . ,0
2479,"none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . ",0
2480," . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . ",0
2481,"as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . ",0
2482,"splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . ",0
2483, . . . has virtually no script at all . . . ,0
2484,"will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . ",0
2485,"this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . ",0

2490,"liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . ",0
2491, . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . ,0
2492,the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . ,0
2493,"dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . ",0
2494,a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . ,0
2495,a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . ,0

2497,the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . ,0
2498,shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . ,0
2499,"this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . ",0
2500,"all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . ",0
2501,"if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . ",0
2502,formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . ,0
2503,"only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . ",0
2504,"when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . ",0
2505,"[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . ",0
2506,the film is really not so much bad as bland . ,0
2507,the central story lacks punch . ,0
2508,"though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . ",0
2509,"this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . ",0
2510,"succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . ",0
2511,a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . ,0
2512,what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . ,0
2513,the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . ,0
2514," "" men in black ii , "" has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? ",0
2515,sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . ,0
2516,"this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . ",0
2517,"while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . ",0
2518,"a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . ",0
2519,"the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . ",0
2520,"the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . ",0
2521,the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture,0
2522,"a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . ",0
2523,"apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 "" black and white portable tv . ",0
2524,"the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . ",0

2534,"it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . ",0
2535,fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . ,0
2536,"a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . ",0
2537,a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . ,0

2543,the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . ,0
2544,"just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . ",0
2545,"to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . ",0
2546,"this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . ",0
